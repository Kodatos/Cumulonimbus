# Cumulonimbus
#### Work in progress weather app to practice all topics covered in the intermediate and advanced Android Udacity course
- The weather data is requested from *Open Weather Map*. However the free API package is used, so widescale usage is currently not possible. As it is the very first project involving Android, using paid API is currently not desired.
- The *Data Binding Library* is used as much as possible, but efforts are made to not make the xml files a mess with unnecessary code. The model classes do not implement Observable, since they are updated as whole from database.
- The goal is to make the UI clean and responsive, so themes and animated UI changes are a priority, even if they have to be learned fresh.
- The weather icons are colored and modified versions of [**Climacons**](https://github.com/AdamWhitcroft/climacons), courtesy Adam Whitcroft.
- The app is still work in progress, so there is a lot of work to be done yet.
